LAOISE LUCIANO - PHISHING MACHINE LEARNING

March 5, 2020

This was a project for my AI Cybersecurity class during the Spring 2020 Semester at the University of New Haven.

Our objective was to examine two different models.  Logistic Regression on a phishing dataset and SVM on a spam dataset.

The logistic regression model ended up showing Accuracy: 92.33, Precision: 91.79 and 94.46 and was a great model for this type of data.

The model using SVM had accuracy of 84% with 6 misclassified samples.  Although the final accuracy of the model was above 75% and is still considered a "good" model, I could not get the accuracy to improve based on the data that was given.
